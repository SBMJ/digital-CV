## About me

I am a well-organised, efficient working professional looking to progress and develop my skill set. I am extremely goal oriented ensuring I reach not only my personal career goals, but also my professional deadlines. I am used to working within a demanding, fast-paced environment, both within a team and take initiative to work independently to ensure deadlines and goals are met. I am looking to gain experience in my field whilst completing my Computing and Data Science degree (part-time, evening)
